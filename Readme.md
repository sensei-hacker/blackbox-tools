# Blackbox flight data recorder tools

![Rendered flight log frame](screenshots/blackbox-screenshot-1.jpg)

## Introduction

These tools allow you to convert flight data logs recorded by INAV's Blackbox feature into CSV files (comma-separated values) for analysis, or into a series of PNG files which you could turn into a video.

You can download the latest executable versions of `blackbox_decode` x86_64 on Linux, MacOS or Windows, aarch64 on Linux and MacOS, riscv64 on Linux from the "releases" tab. If you're running a different OS/Arch, or you need `blackbox_render`, you can build the tools from source (instructions are further down this page).

## Using the blackbox_decode tool

This is a *command line* tool. It should be run from a "shell" (e.g. "bash", "zsh", "cmd", "powershell" etc.)

In order to converts a flight log binary ".TXT" file into CSV format, a typical usage (from the command line) would be like:

```bash
blackbox_decode LOG00001.TXT
```

That'll decode the log to `LOG00001.01.csv` and print out some statistics about the log. If you're using Windows, you can drag and drop your log files onto `blackbox_decode` and they'll all be decoded, but this prevents using some of the more useful options listed below. Please note that you shouldn't discard the original ".TXT" file, because it is required as input for other tools like the PNG image renderer.

If your log file contains GPS data then a ".gpx" file will also be produced. This file can be opened in Google Earth or some other GPS mapping software for analysis. You can also include more comprehensive GPS data in the log file, for example:

* Add flight date / time to the CSV
* Include GPS information in the CSV

```
blackbox_decode --datetime --merge-gps LOG00042.TXT
```

Use the `--help` option to show more details and all the options, for example:

Please note that `blackbox_decode` is not intended to insert "derived values" in the output CSV files. If this is desired, it can easily be done, perhaps as part of a pipeline, outside of `blacbox_decode`.

## Using the blackbox_redact tool

This tool alters GPS location data in blackbox logs so you can share them without revealing where you flew. It offsets GPS home coordinates and waypoints by a random or user-specified amount.

### Basic usage

```bash
blackbox_redact LOG00001.TXT LOG00001_redacted.TXT
```

This applies a random coordinate offset (3–15° latitude, 1–10° longitude) — far enough to hide your location while small enough to avoid obvious visual distortion. Latitude allows a wider range because 1° latitude is ~111 km everywhere on Earth, while longitude distance varies with latitude.

### User-specified offset

You can supply your own offset instead of using a random one:

```bash
blackbox_redact --delta-lat=2.5 --delta-lon=-5.0 LOG00001.TXT LOG00001_redacted.TXT
```

If only one of `--delta-lat` or `--delta-lon` is given, the other defaults to 0.

### Options

```text
Options:
  --delta-lat <degrees>  Latitude offset in degrees (default: random)
  --delta-lon <degrees>  Longitude offset in degrees (default: random)
  --help                 Show help message
```

### Example output

```
Original home:  lat=-33.3134811  lon= 149.0948991
Applied offset: lat +3.2145000  lon  -8.5120000
Redacted home:  lat=-30.0989811  lon= 140.5828991
```

### Notes

- Output coordinates are normalized: latitude is clamped to ±90°, longitude wraps to ±180°
- G-frames (GPS track data) are not modified — they encode positions as deltas from GPS home, so they shift automatically
- Waypoint coordinates in text headers are also offset
- A `H Relocated:1` header is added to the output to indicate the log has been relocated
- The relocation is a naive offset (not a geodetic reprojection), so distances and angles are not perfectly preserved — this is acceptable for small offsets

## Using the blackbox_render tool

This tool converts a flight log binary ".TXT" file into a series of transparent PNG images that you could overlay onto your flight video using a video editor (like [DaVinci Resolve][] ). Typical usage (from the command line) would be like:

```bash
blackbox_render LOG00001.TXT
```

This will create PNG files at 30 fps into a new directory called `LOG00001.01` next to the log file.

Use the `--help` option to show more details:

### Assembling video with DaVinci Resolve

![DaVinci Resolve screenshot](screenshots/davinci-resolve-screenshot.jpg)

[DaVinci Resolve][] is one free option for turning your PNGs into a video that is synced with your flight video.

In Resolve, create a new project. On the Media tab, find your flight video and drag it from the top pane to the bottom one to add it to your media library. When prompted, choose the option to change your framerate/resolution settings to match the video you added. Now add the PNG series that you rendered with `blackbox_render` (it'll be represented as a single file). If the PNGs don't appear in the media library, try right clicking on the folder that contains them and
selecting "Refresh".

Now over on the Edit tab, click File -> New Timeline and click Ok. At the top left, switch over to the Media Pool. Drag and drop your flight video onto the timeline, then drag and drop the Blackbox stream onto the video track above it. You'll need to play around with the alignment between the two tracks to sync things up (I usually sync up the audio from the initial throttle-up with the throttle-up shown on the motor graph).

If your Blackbox PNGs were rendered using the default settings (30 FPS) and your flight video is 60 FPS, you'll need to right-click on the Blackbox stream and click "change clip speed". Enter 30 FPS since this is the FPS that you rendered the Blackbox PNGs at.

Save your viewers' ears by dragging the midpoint of the audio track downwards to reduce its volume, or replace the audio with your own music track!

Now on the Deliver tab, choose something like the "video sharing export" Easy Setup preset. On the left pane, choose an output folder for the "render to:" setting. Then click the "add job to render queue" button on the left. Now click the "start render" button on the right to begin rendering the output.

## Building tools

If you just want to download some prebuilt versions of `blackbox_decode` head to the "releases" tab on the GitHub page. However, if you want to build your own binaries, or you're an unsupported platform where we haven't provided binaries, please read on.

The `blackbox_decode` tool for turning binary flight logs into CSV doesn't depend on any libraries, so can be built by running `make obj/blackbox_decode`. You can add the resulting `obj/blackbox_decode` program to your system path to make it easier to run.

The `blackbox_render` tool renders a binary flight log into a series of PNG images which you can overlay on your flight video. Please read the section below that most closely matches your operating system for instructions on getting the `libcairo` library required to build the `blackbox_render` tool.

### Version Information

The version is set in `src/version.h`. If you wish, you may override this with the environment variable `BLACKBOX_VERSION` (e.g. `make BLACKBOX_VERSION=x.y.z-local`).

The Makefile attempts to evince an environment variable `BLACKBOX_COMMIT`; this is set, the git commit id will also be shown as part of the version. You may override this:

```
$ blackbox_decode --version
7.0.1 INAV 123714c

$ BLACKBOX_COMMIT=uncommitted make
$ blackbox_decode --version
7.0.1 INAV uncommitted
```

#### Linux

You will need `gcc` (or `clang`), `make` and (for `blackbox_render`), `libcairo2` (development files).

For Debian (Ubuntu etc.), you can get the tools required for building by entering these commands into the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make gcc libcairo2-dev
```
Otherwise, search the distro package manager and install equivalents.

Then, build blackbox_render by running `make obj/blackbox_render` (or build both tools by just running `make`).

#### FreeBSD

You will need `clang` (`cc`), `gmake` and `libcairo2`. Use `pkg` to install.

Then:

```
gmake
```

#### MacOSX

The easiest way to build is to install the `Xcode development tool` (`xcode-select --install`), then install an environment like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (untested) onto your system.

From MacPorts / Homebrew you need to install `cairo`.

Then you can run `make` to build.

MacOS `blacbox_decode` can also be cross-compiled on Linux using the supplied `Makefile`.

#### Windows

The tools can be cross-compiled on Linux (`blackbox_decode.exe` using the supplied `Makefile`, or built natively in MSys2 (Win32 and Win64), using the `Makefile`. You will need to install the required tools and libraries (`pacman -S  make gcc cairo`).

Historically, the tools could be built with Visual Studio Express 2013; open up the solution in the `visual-studio/` folder. You'll need to include the .DLL files from `lib/win32` in the same directory as your built executable. This is no longer supported and is unlikely to work.

#### Install from build

The `Makefile` includes an `install` stanza. This may be augmented by `prefix` to specify the installation directory prefix, which otherwise defaults to `/usr/local`.

For example, with `prefix` set to  `$HOME/.local`:

```
# Note "/bin" is appended by the Makefile
make install prefix=~/.local
```

Results in:
```
$HOME/.local/bin/blackbox_decode
$HOME/.local/bin/blackbox_render
```
